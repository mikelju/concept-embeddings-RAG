# Security audits

Consolidated catalogue of the audits run with `/8-auditar` (skill `audit-code`). One row per
report; findings stay in the report, not here.

## Reports

| Date | Mode | Scope | Critical | High | Medium | Low | Info |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| [2026-09-08](audit-2026-09-08-fase-1.md) | fase 1 | `src/` (20 files), `pyproject.toml`, `.gitignore`, CI workflow | 0 | 0 | 4 | 4 | 2 |
| [2026-09-08 (re-audit)](audit-2026-09-08-fase-1-2.md) | fase 1, 2nd pass | the above, plus the `fix-1` changes themselves | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 (2 found and fixed in-pass) | 3 |

## Open findings

None. Every finding from both passes is closed, each held closed by a regression test.
Phase 1 has no blocking security work outstanding.

| ID | Severity | Title | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| SEC-001 | Medium | Corpus integrity check recorded, never enforced | Fixed ([fix-1](../plans/fixes/fix-1_audit_phase_1_findings.md)) |
| SEC-002 | Medium | Embedding model resolved from a branch, not a pinned commit | Fixed (fix-1) |
| SEC-003 | Medium | `load_pool` did not re-derive the ids it loaded | Fixed (fix-1) |
| SEC-004 | Medium | Unbounded pagination and response size when fetching the corpus | Fixed (fix-1) |
| SEC-005 | Low | SHA-1 for content addressing without `usedforsecurity=False` | Fixed (fix-1) |
| SEC-006 | Low | Result filename built from unvalidated `split` / `system` | Fixed (fix-1) |
| SEC-007 | Low | CI secret scan could not fail; dependency gate ran on Python 3.11 | Fixed (fix-1) |
| SEC-008 | Low | `CorpusManifest` validated field names but not types | Fixed (fix-1) |
| SEC-009 | Low | The SEC-001 fix covered one branch of `cmd_fetch` and not the other | Fixed in the re-audit |
| SEC-010 | Low | `load_pool` verified units but not that gold ids resolved | Fixed in the re-audit |

Accepted by design, not fixed: OBS-002 (trust-on-first-use), OBS-003 (`resolved_revision` proves
less than its name suggests), OBS-004 (`_check_pool_against_manifest` fails open without a
manifest), OBS-005 (superseded embedding cache kept on disk). Each is argued in its report.

## Standing gaps

- **No dependency CVE scan has ever run on this project.** `pip-audit` is not installed locally
  (CLAUDE.md gotcha 7). The CI job is now capable of running it — SEC-007 fixed the Python version
  and pointed it at the `uv.lock` export — but it has not yet run. Until it does, no audit here
  can claim dependencies were checked against a vulnerability database.

## Conventions

- Report path: `docs/security/audit-YYYY-MM-DD-<mode>.md`; a second pass on the same day and mode
  takes the `-2` suffix.
- Every Critical or High finding is resolved with a `fix-N` in `docs/plans/fixes/` before the
  phase closes, or the decision to defer it is recorded in the master plan with its reason.
- Finding ids are unique per project: continue the `SEC-NNN` sequence in the next report rather
  than restarting it. Next free id: **SEC-011**.
